# Competitive Pokémon Web App

## Description
This web application is designed for competitive Pokémon players. It provides detailed information about Pokémon tiers, individual Pokémon stats, types, and sprites. Users can navigate through different tiers (like Ubers, OU, etc.) and view the Pokémon in each category. The main goal is to offer a clean and simple interface for trainers to quickly access competitive Pokémon data.

The app is built with React and features a responsive design to ensure a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
