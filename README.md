# Pokebuild Champions

Welcome to **Pokebuild Champions**, a web application designed for competitive Pokémon players. This tool allows users to analyze Pokémon stats, build competitive teams, and explore the vast database of the Pokémon world.

## 1. Description of the Main Page

The main page serves as the central hub for the application, designed with a focus on usability and quick access to competitive data.

* **Hero Section:** Features a dynamic search bar that allows users to instantly find Pokémon by name or Pokédex ID.
* **Team Builder Interface:** A dedicated interactive area where users can select up to six Pokémon. It provides real-time feedback on type coverage and team balance.
* **Stats Dashboard:** When a Pokémon is selected, the page displays a detailed card showing base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed), available abilities, and type weaknesses/resistances.
* **Responsive Grid:** The layout utilizes a responsive grid system, ensuring the competitive tools are accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 2. Third-Party Components

To build this application, several open-source libraries and APIs were utilized to handle data fetching, styling, and interactivity:

* **[Google Fonts]:** Used to implement the specific typography that matches the gaming aesthetic.
* **[FontAwesome / Ionicons]:** Utilized for the user interface icons (search magnifying glass, menu bars, social links).
* **[Chart.js / ApexCharts] (Optional):** Used to render the radar charts for visualizing Pokémon base stats.
